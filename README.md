# Hi, I'm Ashu Choudhury ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a versatile developer who explores anything that challenges me. I work across multiple languages and platforms, building software that pushes boundaries and delivers practical, efficient, and innovative solutions.

From system-level tools to creative applications, automation, and accessibility-focused projects, I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant solutions. My work spans desktop, mobile, and web environments, with a focus on building tools that are reliable, impactful, and easy to use.

Always open to collaboration and contribution, I aim to create software that matters and solve problems that others overlook.
